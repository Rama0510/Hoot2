 fantastic project concept Both users/students and library administrators would find an app that can manage a book library to be of greatutility.It's encouraging to learn that the app uses Cloud Firestore as the back-end database to store book and user information and Firebase Cloud Messaging to notify users in real-time. Another excellent strategy is to use Cloud Functions to keep an eye on the database and send out alerts.To make it simple for users to carry out a variety of tasks, like adding/removing/updating books,searching for books, issuing/re-issuing/returning books, and gathering fines, it's crucial to make sure the app has a user-friendly and interactive design.Also, it would be crucial to guarantee that the software is safe and that users' private data is secured.Overall, this project has great promise and may assist to simplify book management procedures for both consumers and library administrators.
